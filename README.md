# Care-Talker:
Care-Talker is an educational project providing teachers and educators with the tools to produce interactive text-based lessons that respond to the emotional necesities of students. By classifing responses and response patterns into different emotional categories, Care-Talker will be able to identify if a student feels frustrated, dissinterested, curious, confused, or excited by the lesson material, allowing the lesson designer to pre-program apropiate responses that will make the student feel engaged and validated through their learning process.
